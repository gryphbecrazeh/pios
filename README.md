## We are deploying this week, need to set up static ip address, as well as raspberri pi to function as server

##############################################################################################################
QUESTIONS
##############################################################################################################

## On the order manager page

## once an order is ready to ship

## awaiting items have been received, and others have been in stock and ready

# how would the quantity react to broken up orders?

like 1 in stock, 1 on order to ka, and 1 on order that will be delivered to the customer
the shipment would only be required to keep track of the orders leaving ka as the order being delivered fro the vendor to the customer would be it's own shipment, to be determined
when the order is ready at the ka level, only the amounts ready should be provided
to obtain that value, it should adjust the remaining quantity
the total quantities should be stored inside of object in the database
therefore there should be a ka-ship talley that is set by the amounts available in ka are determined by what is in stock and what is received, the number shown on the ready card should be the ka-talley, and have no reflection of the items being sent, and should absolutely not be reflected by the skus_quantity value as that value is soley for record purposes,and determines the remaining value, addressing that value directly will misrepresent the total amount being sent in the shipment from KA

# should we allow for breaking up orders to ship separately?

I think so, I doubt that we would wait until an order is completely fulfilled to send out, ideally it will be, as well as being paid completely in full, I will need to research further into this problem to find out if there are ever cases in which we send out an order before it is paid in full, I know we shouldn't but who knows.

# What is the minimum criteria to be met for an order to be ready to ship?

If we do decide to move forward with a shipment before it has been paid for in its entirety/etc, then the order should definitely be flagged as important, and be easy to follow then entirety of the shipment

BUGS
##############################################################################################################

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Ubuntu deployment won't start, node-sass issue

# Here is the solution sudo npm install --unsafe-perm node-sass

order manager can get out of sync and lose all products, but re-appear on refresh
=======
- ORDER CHECKED AND INSTOCK APPENEDED IT TO ANOTHER ORDER \*

- SELECTING CURRENTLY IN STOCK BLANKS THE PAGE RATHER THAN GETTING THE UPDATED INFORMATION \*

- REMOVING ORDERD SKUS STILL DOESN'T HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY/REMOVING ORDERED SKUS REMOVES THINGS OTHER THAN THE ORDERED SKU THAT WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE \*

order manager can get oout of sync and lose all products, but re-appear on refresh
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
disappear on entering and exitting a modal from another page, more than likely from the clear orderedSkus function
-to fix, get ordered skus on page load of orderManager, or, getOrderedSkus through top componenet, and filter the ordered skus when accessed from order specific modals, and never clear

#removing items from order can remove seemingly random item

adding item as ready to ship, adds the item to whatever order is ready to ship at the time

setting order as ready to ship on order manager page, causes everything to disappear

#CHANGING A USER LOGS YOU INTO THAT USER
#CREATING NEW USER, ON INITIAL TABLE RENDER, DUPLICATES THE LOWEST USERS USER DATA, PROBABLY NOT WAITING TO RECOVER DATA FROM SERVER

#unhandled rejection data of undefined when logging in, caused by navbar attempting to get roles, not returning roles

SHOW ALL / SHOW FILTERED RESULTS CAN GET OUT OF SYNC AND REVERSE ITSELF

alert DBKEYS has not ready to ship, even though status is ready to ship

removing items from order needs refresh after every removed item

#Alerts can repopulate on refresh, probably getting all alerts from somewhere else, attempted to fix this issue, but now they disappear completely on refresh
#if(!alerts||!alerts.length>0) doesn't work, it is possibly still storing the alerts somewhere

#alerts do not generate on page refresh
#pipelined the get requests, on component did mount, it gets the items with filters from the filter reducer, on get completetion, it then calls getAlerts with the results after #the item reducer has put the results in the state, the alerts container just passes back all the alerts from the redux state

#shuffling pages can cause app to crash because of alerts not being able an order that's status works, problem being that alerts is being called at the same time, or too soon, #before getItems has brought the items to the store
#receiving manager->order manager crashes app on getAlerts

#ON LOAD, VALIDATION DOES NOT HAPPEN UNTIL AFTER A FEW CYCLES, BOOKMARKING PAGES ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING
#Navbar and welcome page seem to cause this issue
#changed from isAuthenticated to checking if the token exists in the local storage, doesn't reload every time, can bookmark and just enter urls directly
